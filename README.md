## :chart_with_upwards_trend:	 Description

Text generation is a type of natural language processing (NLP) task that involves generating text from a given input. It is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-like text from a given input. Text generation is used in a variety of applications, such as summarization, dialogue systems, and machine translation. 

In this repo, I collect text generation exercises that I did for my computer engineering graduation project. This repo will be updated continuously.
